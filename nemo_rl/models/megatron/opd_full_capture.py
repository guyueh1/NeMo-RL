"""Capture the pre-LM-head hidden states of a frozen MOPD teacher.

Full-vocabulary MOPD ships these to the student, which projects them with a
teacher LM-head shard. Moving ``hidden_size`` floats per token instead of
``vocab_size`` keeps teacher and student parallelism decoupled.

The capture is a forward pre-hook on ``output_layer``: ``GPTModel.forward`` ends
in ``logits, _ = self.output_layer(hidden_states, ...)``, so the hook's first
argument is the post-``final_layernorm`` hidden state. Hooking ``decoder``
instead would miss ``final_layernorm``, and ``decoder.final_layernorm`` is absent
under some transformer specs.
