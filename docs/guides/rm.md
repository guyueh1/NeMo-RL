# Reward Model Training in NeMo RL

This document explains how to train reward models (RM) within NeMo RL. Currently, only Bradley-Terry reward models are supported on the DTensor backend. Megatron backend support is tracked [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/issues/720).

## Launch a Training Job

The script, [examples/run_rm.py](../../examples/run_rm.py), is used to train a Bradley-Terry reward model. This script can be launched either locally or via Slurm. For details on how to set up Ray and launch a job using Slurm, refer to the [cluster documentation](../cluster.md).

Be sure to launch the job using `uv`. The command to launch a training job is as follows:

```bash
uv run examples/run_rm.py

# Can also add overrides on CLI, like changing the config or changing the model
uv run examples/run_rm.py --config examples/configs/rm.yaml policy.model_name=Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B
```

The default YAML config shares the same base template as the SFT config but includes a new `reward_model_cfg` section with `enabled: true` to load the model as a Reward Model. You can find an example RM config file at [examples/configs/rm.yaml](../../examples/configs/rm.yaml).

**Reminder**: Set your `HF_HOME`, `WANDB_API_KEY`, and `HF_DATASETS_CACHE` (if needed). Make sure to log in using `huggingface-cli` if you're working with Llama models.

## Datasets

Each RM dataset class is expected to have the following attributes:
1. `formatted_ds`: The dictionary of formatted datasets, where each dataset should be formatted like
```json
{
  "context": [], // list of dicts - The prompt message (including previous turns, if any)
  "completions": [ // list of dicts — The list of completions
    {
      "rank": 0, // int — The rank of the completion (lower rank is preferred)
      "completion": [] // list of dicts — The completion message(s)
    },
    {
      "rank": 1, // int — The rank of the completion (lower rank is preferred)
      "completion": [] // list of dicts — The completion message(s)
    }
  ]
}
```
2. `task_spec`: The `TaskDataSpec` for this dataset. This should specify the name you choose for this dataset.

Currently, RM training supports only two completions (where the lowest rank is preferred and the highest one is rejected), with each completion being a single response. For example:
```json
{
    "context": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What's the capital of France?"
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "The capital of France is Paris."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Thanks! And what's the capital of Germany?"
        }
    ],
    "completions": [
        {
            "rank": 0,
            "completion": [
                {
                    "role": "assistant",
                    "content": "The capital of Germany is Berlin."
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "rank": 1,
            "completion": [
                {
                    "role": "assistant",
                    "content": "The capital of Germany is Munich."
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

NeMo RL provides a RM-compatible implementation of the [HelpSteer3](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/blob/main/nemo_rl/data/hf_datasets/helpsteer3.py) dataset as an example. This dataset is downloaded from Hugging Face and preprocessed on-the-fly, so there's no need to provide a path to any datasets on disk.

We also provide a [PreferenceDataset](../../nemo_rl/data/hf_datasets/preference_dataset.py) class that is compatible with JSONL-formatted preference datasets. You can modify your config as follows to use such a custom preference dataset:
```yaml
data:
  dataset_name: PreferenceDataset
  train_data_path: <LocalPathToTrainingDataset>
  val_data_paths:
    <NameOfValidationDataset>: <LocalPathToValidationDataset>
```
with support for multiple validation sets achieved with:
```yaml
data:
  dataset_name: PreferenceDataset
  train_data_path: <LocalPathToTrainingDataset>
  val_data_paths:
    <NameOfValidationDataset1>: <LocalPathToValidationDataset1>
    <NameOfValidationDataset2>: <LocalPathToValidationDataset2>
```
Please note:
- If you are using a logger, the prefix used for each validation set will be `validation-<NameOfValidationDataset>`. The total validation time, summed across all validation sets, is reported under `timing/validation/total_validation_time`.
- If you are doing checkpointing, the `metric_name` value in your `checkpointing` config should reflect the metric and validation set to be tracked. For example, `validation-<NameOfValidationDataset1>_loss`.
